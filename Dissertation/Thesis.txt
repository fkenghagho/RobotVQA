Definition of the problem:

The problem is two-fold:

* Scene understanding for robotic manipulation tasks 
	+ Contributions
	       - Full Fix-Format-Graph-based Scene Description within a single Deep-Learning Model, which generalizes VQA
                 It is an extension of Mask-RCNN(Category, Mask, Bounding Box):
			* Integration of Additional submodules for:
				- Material
				- Color
				- Shape
				- Openability
				- 6-D pose
				- Spatial Relationship
				- 7-Channel Input(Color, Normal and Depth Maps)	
				
				

* Demonstration of high applicability of photorealistic virtual worlds in training Robot vision systems
	+ Contributions:
               - Virtual world
	       - Synthetic dataset
