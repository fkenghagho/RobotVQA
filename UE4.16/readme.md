1. This thesis also contributed to the development of new virtual object materials, textures and meshes.

2. The folder Content would represent the content-folder of a normal UE4.16-project folder.

*Note: Since the texture and material files are almost 1 GB big, they are kept on the server of the IAI Institute at University Bremen, Germany.
	  *A link will be soon provided for accessing to them. Only the images for overview are provided by the folder Content
